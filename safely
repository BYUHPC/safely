# Usage
usage="usage: $0 [-w writable/directory ...] [--] command [args ...]

$0 runs an arbitrary command while restricting write access to explicitly specified directories. It can allow you to run potentially risky commands in a controlled setting.

Any directory specified with \`-w\` or \`--writable\` can be written in, including subdirectories, but no directories outside of those specified can be modified by the command.

As an example, '$0 --writable /tmp rm -rf $HOME/*' will fail to destroy your home directory, but '$0 --writable $HOME rm -rf $HOME/*' will succeed."
